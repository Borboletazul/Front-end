# html- hypertext markup language <br>
in a .hmtl file you mark the structure of the text in the site <br>
see more in the code: <br>

<!--
<h1>text here</h1> - mark the text as level 1 title

<p> text </p> - mark the text inside as a paragraph

<a> google</a> - link to another page/diretoy/file, and you can add a reference
to the link href="google.com" and it could send the user to the adress
One of the most important thing in the structure of the site are the boxes
<div> </div>

to set some specifc elements of the text to an especifc style (color/background/
size) in CSS you shoudl mark before in html, in order to do that we have the "id"
and "class"
with id you set for one element(text or image) a specific reference, that in the CSS
 file linked you refeer that one, with the class you mark a group of elements
<p id="paragrafo1"> texto aqui </p>
<h1 class="Titulo1> Texto aqui </h1>

to set a generict inline mark, we have the tag "span"
<span> any text </span>
-->

# CSS - cascading style sheets

in a ".css" file you set the style of the marked text (marked with html)
by linking the hmtl file to a css file <br>
see in the code:<br>

<!--
in the css file linked with the html, you can set the sytle specificaly to an text mark<br>
 or part of the text:
p{
  color: red;
}
set all the paragraphs text color to red.

To modify an specific id or class marked with html:
id:
#paragrafo1 {
  color: black;
}
class:
.Titulo1{
background-color: red;
}


-->
# Resume:
the html file will contain the structure and types of text and 
the css file will contain the style of the text, such as color, background and others<br>

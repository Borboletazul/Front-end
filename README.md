# Front-end skills
Repository to post some initial concetpts about .hmtl, .CSS and JavaScript


# html- hypertext markup language

in a .hmtl file you mark the structure of the text in the site 

see more in the code:

<!-- <h1>text here</h1> - mark the text as level 1 title
<p> text </p> - mark the text inside as a paragraph
<a> google</a> - link to another page/diretoy/file, and you can add a reference
to the link href="google.com" and it could send the user to the adress
-->

# CSS - cascading style sheets

in a ".css" file you set the style of the marked text (marked with html)
by linking the hmtl file to a a css, 


the html file will contain the structure and types of text and 
the css file will contain the style of the text, such as color, background and others

# Front-end skills
Repository to post some initial concetpts about .hmtl, .CSS and JavaScript <br>

# html- hypertext markup language <br>
in a .hmtl file you mark the structure of the text in the site <br>
see more in the code: <br>

<!-- 
<h1>text here</h1> - mark the text as level 1 title

<p> text </p> - mark the text inside as a paragraph

<a> google</a> - link to another page/diretoy/file, and you can add a reference
to the link href="google.com" and it could send the user to the adress
One of the most important thing in the structure of the site are the boxes
<div> </div>
-->

# CSS - cascading style sheets

in a ".css" file you set the style of the marked text (marked with html)
by linking the hmtl file to a css file <br>
see in the code:<br>

<!--
in the css file linked with the html, you can set the sytle specificaly to an text mark<br>
 or part of the text:

p{
  color: red;
}

set all the paragraphs text color to red
-->
# Resume:
the html file will contain the structure and types of text and 
the css file will contain the style of the text, such as color, background and others<br>
Box-Model: Most of the the web sites are designed using boxes to guide the structure of the content
in the scream, shuch as images and texts, the boxes help to set the contents in the righ place
in order to have a good interface

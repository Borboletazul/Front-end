Repository to post some initial concetpts about .hmtl, .CSS and JavaScript


# html- hypertext markup language

in a .hmtl archive you mark the structure of the text in the site 

<h1>text here</h1> - level 1 title
<p> text </p> - you mark the text inside as a paragraph
<a> google</a> - link to another page/diretoy/file, and you can add a reference
to the link href="google.com" and it could send the user to the adress

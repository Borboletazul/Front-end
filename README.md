# Front-end skills
Repository to post some initial concetpts about .hmtl, .CSS and JavaScript <br>

# html- hypertext markup language <br>
in a .hmtl file you mark the structure of the text in the site <br>
see more in the code: <br>

<!-- 
<h1>text here</h1> - mark the text as level 1 title

<p> text </p> - mark the text inside as a paragraph

<a> google</a> - link to another page/diretoy/file, and you can add a reference
to the link href="google.com" and it could send the user to the adress
-->

# CSS - cascading style sheets

in a ".css" file you set the style of the marked text (marked with html)
by linking the hmtl file to a css file <br>
see in the code:<br>

<!--
in the css file linked with the html, you can set the sytle specificaly to an text mark<br>
 or part of the text:

p{
  color: red;
}

set all the paragraphs text color to red
-->
#Resume:
the html file will contain the structure and types of text and 
the css file will contain the style of the text, such as color, background and others
